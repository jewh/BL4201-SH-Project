# 'Biological Factors Impacting Search Space Topology in Bayesian Network Learning'
 University of St Andrews School of Biology Senior Honours Project
 
 Python code for generating various metrics and plot can be see above. 
 _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 'Network_Generator.py' creates simulated data
 
 'get_surface.py' reads static and dynamic banjo output files and calculates rho for each search, and plots search statistics
 
 '3d.py' generates the search space topology diagram seen in the report
 
 'settings_generator.py' reads a banjo settings templates and generates banjo settings for all files in its directory
 
 'dynamicsettingsgenerator.py' does the same but includes all observations files in its directory in a settings file
 
 'q3_discretiser.py' discretises data into q3 states then calculates the metric d for the dataset
 
 'Milns_discretiser.py' discretises data into Milns states
 
 'silence_data.py' obtains data for half network subgraphs from a data file for a bipartite graph
 
 'data_processor.py' analyses RIS data and extracts the desired location and species data.
